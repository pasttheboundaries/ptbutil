this is a private utility repository

it is not aimed at any other purpose than supporting my own work
however one may find some solutions there that might be useful

namespaces and packages contain scripts, functions, classes and snippets


probabbly one of the most usefull classes is StringTree in module tree
I used it multiple times for nlp in Polish language.
Polish language recquires lematization = finding a lemat of a word
To keep all lemats of all known words in memory would take losts of resources.
Also, querrying over such a set would be very time consumeing.
StringTree solves this problem satisfactory.

Quit a spectacular class in RomanNumeral also.
Never tested it for speed but, I believe, it excercises flawless encoding - decoding algorythm.
It is also quite flexible.
Made it a long time ago, and I am not sure about errors handling.
I used it also for text data extraction
