    """
    RTW [read-transform-write] decorator will use the decorated function
        as a transformator function for lines read from a source file.
    The decorated function must be designed so:
     -it accepts a single argument - a text line [read from an open file iterator],
     -it returns a single line ended with a '\n' sign [to be saved in a destination file]
    RTW returns a wrapper that will not accept any argument. Once it is called (without any argument) it will:
    - start separate threading.Thread for every source file:
    - start reading lines from the source file , transforming and saving them to the destination file.
    - will return working processes in a list [so the threading.Thread.join method can be used later]
    Reading and writing is lazy - so it will not impinge memory unless to many files are attempted to be opened.
    The destination files will have the same name as the source files - but will be placed in the destination directory.

    RTW arguments:
    - sources: list - a list of absolute paths to source files
    - destination_dir - a directory for the destination files to be saved in
    - n_lines: int =- a number of lines to be read and transformed as a batch before writing to a file.
    (Writing to a file is time expensive, so it pays to write once in a while in batches BUT
    reading many lines at the same time is memory consuming - best performance setting must be done by trials)

    WARNING:
        for the decorator to work, the sources [filenames] and destination_dir must be known at the decoration time \
        and those are usually known only at runtime - in that case this decorator might be useless.
